WARNING: Running StarRC in single corner mode will result in degraded runtime for design flows where
         multiple corners are used.  For optimal runtime, add the necessary commands to configure
         the Simultaneous Multicorner flow (CORNERS_FILE and SELECTED_CORNERS). (SX-3552)

NOTE: Simultaneous Multicorner (SMC) is now the default mode for StarRC gate-level extraction.
By running SMC, the overall runtime can be reduced by up to 2x with the same level of accuracy
as single corner extraction. For more information, consult the Simultaneous Multicorner Section
in the StarRC User Guide.
