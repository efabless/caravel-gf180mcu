NOTE: Simultaneous Multicorner (SMC) is now the default mode for StarRC gate-level extraction.
By running SMC, the overall runtime can be reduced by up to 2x with the same level of accuracy
as single corner extraction. For more information, consult the Simultaneous Multicorner Section
in the StarRC User Guide.
